# Storytelling with Data using BigQuery

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate the power of storytelling through data using real-world event data from BigQuery. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from large datasets and present them in a compelling narrative form that resonates with stakeholders. We aim to showcase how data can be transformed into impactful stories that drive decision-making and spark innovation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to leverage BigQuery’s event data to create a series of data-driven stories, exploring trends, patterns, and insights from the data. By combining data analysis with storytelling techniques, we provide a more accessible and engaging way for non-technical audiences to understand and act on data insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration and Extraction**: Use SQL queries on BigQuery to extract relevant event data.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Prepare the data for analysis by removing noise, handling missing values, and transforming variables as needed.
- **Data Visualization**: Use various visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau) to create visuals that support the narrative.
- **Storytelling with Data**: Develop data stories with key insights and recommendations that are clear, engaging, and actionable.

## Example Data Story Flow
1. **Understanding User Engagement**: Analyze user engagement patterns by examining clickstreams, session durations, and interaction types.
2. **Identifying Key Events**: Focus on specific high-impact events such as in-app purchases, milestone achievements, or user churn events.
3. **Analyzing User Segmentation**: Segment users based on behavior or demographics to identify different engagement strategies.
4. **Visualizing Trends**: Present insights through clear visuals such as time series charts, heatmaps, and distribution plots.
5. **Crafting the Narrative**: Tell the story of user behavior, highlighting important trends, patterns, and recommendations for product improvement.

## Example Stories
- **Story 1: Why Users Leave – Churn Analysis**  
  A detailed analysis on the reasons behind user churn using event data. We dive into trends and behaviors that are common among users who stop using the product.
  
- **Story 2: Increasing User Retention Through Milestones**  
  Explore how rewarding users with milestones impacts long-term retention, and suggest specific improvements to milestone design based on user behavior data.

- **Story 3: User Journey Mapping**  
  A comprehensive journey map showing how different users interact with the product from the moment they sign up until they become active or disengaged.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DinhNC/storytelling-with-data-on-bigquery
   cd storytelling-with-data-bigquery
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Google Cloud credentials and authenticate with BigQuery.

4. Run the analysis using Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google BigQuery** for querying large datasets.
- **Python** for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **Tableau** (optional) for advanced visual storytelling.

## Next Steps
- Expand to additional data stories, focusing on different event types or user segments.
- Automate data extraction and processing for scalability.
- Implement real-time data stories by integrating live data from BigQuery.
